<a name="contactually-php-library" class="anchor" href="#contactually-php-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contactually PHP Library</h1>

<p>This is a PHP helper for the Contactually API - <a href="http://developers.contactually.com/">http://developers.contactually.com/</a></p>

<p>It is modeled after the Twilio PHP Helper library because I think it's generally well done and thought through. This isn't official but should generally work except for the incomplete items in the TODO list below.</p>

<p>This is v0.8.0 so it is pretty stable and I don't expect the interfaces to change much if at all.</p>

<h2>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>This assumes you have cURL installed along with the corresponding php-curl interface. It could be extended to support other HTTP transport tools but I'm kinda lazy.</p>

<h2>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h2>

<p>You have to have a Contactually account. Then copy the creds-dist.php file to creds.php and fill in the credentials you plan to use. Then you should be able to run any of the scripts in /examples out of the box.</p>

<p>There are two different strategies you can use to authenticate:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use your existing email address and password and initialize the object like so:</li>
</ul><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Services_Contactually</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'email'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'password'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$password</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you can use the API key found here - <a href="https://www.contactually.com/settings/integrations">https://www.contactually.com/settings/integrations</a> - and initialize the object like so:</li>
</ul><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Services_Contactually</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'apikey'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$apikey</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>

<p>While the functional difference between these approaches is negligible, the key-based approach is generally considered better.</p>

<a name="oddities" class="anchor" href="#oddities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Oddities</h2>

<p>These oddities are related to the API:</p>

<ul>
<li> When you authenticate, you get back a 201 response code instead of 200 as you'd expect</li>
<li> When you ignore a contact, you get back a 404 response code no matter what.. whether if it was successfully created or the contact didn't exist</li>
<li> There doesn't seem to be a way to remove the results of a Contact-&gt;ignore()</li>
<li> <del>After you create a resource, you don't get a reference back to it in the response body or the Location header as you'd expect. In order to find the resource, you must search for it</del> - I was wrong, a Location header is provide as you'd expect.</li>
<li> Responses on resource creation are not consistent

<ul>
<li> After successfully creating a Bucket or a Note, you get back a 201 with a Location header to your new bucket or note</li>
<li> After successfully creating a Contact, you get back a 200 with the fully formed resource as if you had done a show (GET). For this helper library, I've hijacked the response to generate the 201-style message to make it the same as the other resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> The pagination of the Contact search results never returns more than ten results from the API regardless of the specified limit</li>
</ul><p>These oddities are related to my implementation of the helper library:</p>

<ul>
<li> Deprecated: <del>When you authenticate, a cookies.txt "cookie jar" file is written. If you don't clear the file, you may still be authenticated regardless of the credentials used. Using the API Key authentication avoids this and is probably better in general as the requests become Stateless.</del>
</li>
