Contactually PHP Library
================

This is a PHP helper for the Contactually API - http://developers.contactually.com/

It is modeled after the Twilio PHP Helper library because I think it's generally well done and thought through. This isn't official but should generally work except for the incomplete items in the TODO list below.

This is v0.01 so it is super rudiment and subject to change at any time.. like now. Or maybe now.
